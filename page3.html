    Please I request you to read this whole, Happy Birthday Ananya.  
    You know me and what kind of person I am, I know I am not perfect maybe as a friend or best friend.  
    Yes, it’s true that I overthink but it does not mean that I don’t trust you, I do trust you, but my thought process is a little different…  
    I just fear losing you. Even if you want to go, I will take that as your will, but until then I don’t want to lose you.  
  </p>

  <p style="font-family: 'Georgia', serif; font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.8; color: #333; text-align: justify; margin: 20px;">
    You might feel controlled or pressurized when I ask you to notify me when you reach home or some situations i may create.  
    I know this is my overthinking, but I only want to see you safe and happy.  
    Sometimes my overthinking makes me text you things I don’t even want to,  
    just to make my mind calm… I know this habit makes things between us worse,  
    but I try not to, and I need time to stop it.  
    After all the struggles, I trust you and only you, and I fear breaking that trust.  
  </p>

    If you read this much, thanks Ananya, you listened to me.  
    As I told you earlier, no matter how bad the problem or the situation becomes,  
    you will always find me beside you.  
    I never drank from that day I promised you… And don’t take me wrong that I always gift you things.  
    You once asked me why… I don’t have any answer to that question, and I don’t want anything in return.  
    I only want you to be by my side.  
  </p>
